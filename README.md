# Task tracker App
Task tracker App is similar to the to-do list app made by using React Hooks.
You can view the deployed app [here](https://mk-task-tracker.netlify.app/).

* The deployed app is just a static website but after deploying this I have made some changes in the code.
* I have used json-server in this project.
* You can use json-server to include a backend part to your project without using an actual database.
